Catering Company Management System for Student Accommodation
This program is designed to help a catering company manage food services for a student accommodation facility. It allows the company to keep track of student details such as their name, student ID, room number, and mess selection (whether they prefer vegetarian, non-vegetarian, or a special mess). The program utilizes classes to organize and store the student information.

How It Works
The program consists of a Student class that represents a student. Each student object contains the following information:

Name: The name of the student.
Student ID: A unique identification number assigned to each student.
Room Number: The number of the room the student is staying in.
Mess Selection: The student's preference for meals, which can be vegetarian, non-vegetarian, or a special mess.
The program provides the following features:

Student Creation: The user can input the student's name, student ID, room number, and mess selection. The program then creates a student object with the provided details.

Updating Mess Selection: After a month or any desired interval, the user can update the mess selection for a specific student. This allows for changes in dietary preferences or any special requests.

Printing Student Details: The program provides a function to display the details of a student, including their name, student ID, room number, and mess selection.

How to Use
To use the program, follow these steps:

Enter the required information for a student, including their name, student ID, room number, and mess selection (vegetarian, non-vegetarian, or special).

Once the details are entered, the program will display the student's information.

After a month or at any desired time, you can update the mess selection for the student by providing the new preference (vegetarian, non-vegetarian, or special).

The program will display the updated student information.

Note
This program is a basic implementation to showcase the usage of classes and member functions in C++. It does not include advanced features such as data validation or storage. In a real-world scenario, additional functionality and error handling would be required.

Feel free to customize and enhance the code to meet your specific requirements.
