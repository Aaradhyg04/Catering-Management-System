Certainly! Here's a layman's documentation for the code:

# Catering Company Management System for Student Accommodation

This program is designed to help a catering company manage food services for a student accommodation facility. It allows the company to keep track of student details such as their name, student ID, room number, and mess selection (whether they prefer vegetarian, non-vegetarian, or a special mess). The program utilizes classes to organize and store the student information.

## How It Works

The program consists of a `Student` class that represents a student. Each student object contains the following information:

- **Name**: The name of the student.
- **Student ID**: A unique identification number assigned to each student.
- **Room Number**: The number of the room the student is staying in.
- **Mess Selection**: The student's preference for meals, which can be vegetarian, non-vegetarian, or a special mess.

The program provides the following features:

1. **Student Creation**: The user can input the student's name, student ID, room number, and mess selection. The program then creates a student object with the provided details.

2. **Updating Mess Selection**: After a month or any desired interval, the user can update the mess selection for a specific student. This allows for changes in dietary preferences or any special requests.

3. **Printing Student Details**: The program provides a function to display the details of a student, including their name, student ID, room number, and mess selection.

## How to Use

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Enter the required information for a student, including their name, student ID, room number, and mess selection (vegetarian, non-vegetarian, or special).

2. Once the details are entered, the program will display the student's information.

3. After a month or at any desired time, you can update the mess selection for the student by providing the new preference (vegetarian, non-vegetarian, or special).

4. The program will display the updated student information.

## Note

This program is a basic implementation to showcase the usage of classes and member functions in C++. It does not include advanced features such as data validation or storage. In a real-world scenario, additional functionality and error handling would be required.

Feel free to customize and enhance the code to meet your specific requirements.
